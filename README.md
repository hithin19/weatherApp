## Features

- **City Search:** Quickly find weather information by entering a city name.
- **24-Hour Forecast:** Displays the upcoming 24-hour weather forecast with hourly details.
- **Geolocation Support:** Use your current location for a tailored weather experience (requires user permission).
- **Robust Error Handling:** Displays helpful error messages if the weather data canâ€™t be retrieved (e.g., invalid city input or location access denied).
